# planny-v2

This is a self project of my own to practice creating a full stack web application using the various tech stacks. A personal itinerary planner where one can plan an itinerary for a holiday trip so that one does not get so lost not knowing what to do during the trip.

## Getting Started

The instructions below will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

Make sure to download and install the following items
* Text Editor - Up to your own preference, I personally prefer atom (https://atom.io/)
* Node.js - https://nodejs.org/en/
* PostgreSQL - https://www.postgresql.org/download/
* Heroku CLI - https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli
* Git - https://git-scm.com/

Do remember to check that the environment variables are updated with the above items

Step 1 => Fork the project to your own github account

Step 2 => Git clone the project to your local computer directory using a terminal

```

Step 3 => In the terminal, dive down to the cloned project folder and type this command

until finished
```

And repeat

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why
